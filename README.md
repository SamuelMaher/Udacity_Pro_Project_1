Udacity_Web Professional Track Project-1
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

-create li for ul 
-add a tag to every li
-use for loop to count all sections in document.
-use for loop for eventListener to to by daynamic code for any number of sections.
-use make navigation list highlighted with taregt section.
-each navigation item linked with its target section.
-use two nested for loop.
